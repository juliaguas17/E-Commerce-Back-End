# E-Commerce Back End Starter Code

# Description
My challenge for this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. It takes a working Express.js API and configures it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

# Installation
Run the following commands in the CLI from the Develop folder:
```md
mysql -u root -p
// Enter your SQL password
source db/schema.sql
exit
npm i
node seeds/index.js
npm start
```

NOTE: My code is currently throwing errors related to my initial findAll() GET route that I intend to debug later on.
